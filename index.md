## About Me / Biography

I recently completed my Master’s in Computer Science at Stanford University, where I specialized in human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI). I am now beginning my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Michigan.

My research area is Human-Centered AI with a focus on Social Computing, AI Bias, and AI in healthcare. More generally, my work typically involves implementing agentic AI solutions and workflows, collaborating to define user stories, and designing user experiences that showcase AI capabilities.

Some of my previous work consists of projects with Stanford’s School of Medicine, Stanford HCI in educational technology, and the Stanford Center for Racial Justice. In these projects, I created dashboards that generate insights using large language models (LLMs) rather than traditional heuristics. I utilized LLMs in educational technology to design adaptive, personalized learning experiences, and I explored the relationship between AI and racial discrimination. 

Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Michigan State University and gained industry experience through internships across three different fields: tech/software, aerospace, and energy.

## Research

### Current Research Projects (Overview)

I am currently involved in the following research projects:

- **Project A: Personalized Value-Aligned Language Models**  
  _Keywords:_ value alignment, personalization, large language models

#### Project A: Personalized Value-Aligned Language Models
In this project, I am building and evaluating language models that adapt their behavior to an individual user’s personal values, as measured by Schwartz’s value survey and related scenario-based instruments. We focus on combining psychometric value measurements (PVQ-style items and social dilemma scenarios) with prompt engineering and activation steering techniques to condition model outputs on a user’s value profile. The goal is to understand when and how aligning models to users’ values improves perceived fit, trust, and usefulness without sacrificing safety.

We use methods from representation learning and mechanistic interpretability (e.g., behavior vectors and activation steering), along with web-based data collection (React frontend, Supabase backend) to gather value scores, choices in carefully designed dilemmas, and preferences over model responses. My specific contributions include designing the value-elicitation scenarios, implementing the survey and interaction UI, integrating activation steering into the model pipeline, and analyzing preference data to compare aligned vs. original vs. misaligned model behavior. This work has applications in personal and professional AI assistants, decision support tools, and educational or coaching systems where respecting a user’s values is critical for long-term, trustworthy collaboration.
